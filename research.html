    <h3> Research Interests:  </h3>
    <li class="research"> Authentication:<p>Studying the security aspect of users and login information to ensure it is valid and genuine. In any networking and IT security setting, it is crucial that information is kept secure and that it can be validated by the true user. When authentication is compromised, attackers are able to sneakily overcome control systems undetected. It is vital that authenication is prioritized.</p> </li>
    <li class="research"> Software Security <p>Software Security is primarilly implemented to protect software against any sort of malicious activity. Having a defense system against any foreign attackers is crucial to ensure the longevity of the software and that it functions correctly at all times. Security is a necessity in many computer systems to maintain confidentiality, integrity and Authenticity.  </li>
    <li class="research"> Human Factors <p>Human Factors refers to the scientific process of creating and developing human focused technologies and procedures. Even though we now live in a day and age where computers are performing many of the complicated tasks we are pressed with, humans are still required to operate these systems. If IT foundations are unsuccessful in including people as part of the operation process, this may result in an overly complicated and confusing system that could prove to be inefficient.    </p></li>
    <li class="research"> Usability <p>Usability refers to the quality of a user's experience after accesssing and interacting with websites, applications or other related software. It is paramount that usability of a system is closely monitored and modified if any impacts to speed, effectiveness or overall functionality are noticed. User satisfaction is crucial in a business type setting and ensuring a system is performing to its peak potential at all times is always a good thing.   </p></li>
    <li class="research"> Passwords <p>Pretty self explanatory topic here, passswords are the foundation of any encryption technique to secure almost anything. We use passwords everyday whether it be simply logging in to our phones, any sort of linked accounts we may own and the list goes on! </p></li>
    <li class="research"> Biometrics <p>Biometrics are a different method used for the authenication of a user by validating their physical characteristics. This can be done in a couple different ways however most methods revolve around a scanner of some sort. Fingerprint and Iris scanners are the two primarilly used to ensure it is the authentic user attempting to access whatever the information may be. Generally speaking, these biometric security methods are regarded as very secure compared to other easily hackable methods such as a pin code.   </p> </li>
    <li class="research"> Operating System Security<p>Operating System Security refers to the necessary steps a user should take to protect the confidentiality, Integrity and Authenticity of their operating system on their device. It is taking the available precautions to prevent the OS from encountering worms, viruses, malware or any other malicious content that a user has the potential to encounter. So when discussing OS security, this involves every possible technique and method there is to offer that can be taken to protect your device's operating system  </p> </li>
    <li class="research"> Security Policy<p>The security policy of a company or system details the necessary measures that need to be enforced to constitute the system as truly secure. These can range from a variety of protocols or even certain equipment that is required for the system to be deemed as secure. (Ex. Doors, Locks, Keypads) Almost all reputable and renowned companies have a security policy set in place to not only protect the company from intrusions but simply for the safety of their employees. </p> </li>


    <h3> Research Projects: </h3>
    <li class="research"> Project Title: Human Factors Vs Computer Security</li>
    <p> Julie Thorpe is currently working on a research project that studies the correlation between computer security and human factors. <br><br>
